## What do you need to make this work?

Applications with New Relic APM, Browser, or Mobile agents reporting into New Relic.

## Getting started

1. Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following command. (If you have them installed these commands will return a version number; if not, the commands won't be recognized.)
```bash
git --version
npm -v
```
2. Install the [New Relic One CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) by going to [this link](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) and following the instructions (5 minutes or less) to install and set up your New Relic development environment.
3. Run the following command to clone this repository and run the code locally against your New Relic data:

```bash
nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-attributory.git
cd nr1-attributory
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

Visit [https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local); navigate to APM (listed as Services within New Relic One), Browser or Mobile. Click on the **Attributes Dictionary** option within the left-navigation column, and :sparkles:

## Deploying this Nerdpack

Open a command prompt in the nerdpack's directory and run the following commands.

```bash
# If you need to create a new uuid for the account to which you're deploying this Nerdpack, use the following
# nr1 nerdpack:uuid -g [--profile=your_profile_name]
# to see a list of APIkeys / profiles available in your development environment, run nr1 credentials:list
nr1 nerdpack:publish [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:deploy [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
```

Visit [https://one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com); navigate to APM (listed as Services within New Relic One), Browser or Mobile. Click on the **Attributes Dictionary** option within the left-navigation column, and :sparkles:

## Using Attributory

Attributory displays all attributes for your application stored within New Relic events. Use the search textbox to quickly find a specific attribute or attributes.

If you want Attributory to only display attributes within a specific event, click on the event name listed to the right of the search textbox. This toggles the display of attributes within that event.
